I'm working on a Virtual Assistant using the book entitled: "Building a Virtual Assistant for Raspberry Pi". 
 I'm using a Raspberry Pi 3B and Google Speech Recognition.  
My goal is to eventually have this assistant on a mobile robot. 

I'm also adding a spanish/english/french translator.  So the user can ask it for a word in one language and the user can test themselves
and translate the word.  If they get it right, the VA will let them know.

I've added a working stopwatch with splits (up to 5) and start, stop, reset.
