I'm working on a Virtual Assistant using the book entitled: "Building a Virtual Assistant for Raspberry Pi". 
 I'm using a Raspberry Pi 3B, a ReSpeaker HAT and Google Speech Recognition.  
My goal is to eventually have this assistant on a mobile robot. 

I've also added a spanish translator.  So the user can ask it for a word in one language and the user can test themselves
and translate the word.  If they get it right, the VA will let them know.

I've added a working stopwatch with splits (up to 5) and start, stop, reset.
I've also created a note-taker, list-maker and the notes and list can be seen on a local site.  

I also created a local dashboard that posts the lists and notes.  I can see them on the XX.XXX.XX:5000 site from my iPhone.
